        <p class="explanation">JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content">HTML</a> and the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics">CSS</a>) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.</p>
        <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/What_is_JavaScript/cake.png" alt="A cake with three layers, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The cake is decorated with cherries and a candle on top." class="image">
      <ul>
        <li class="explanation"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content">HTML</a> is the markup language that we use to structure and give meaning to our web content, for example defining paragraphs, headings, and data tables, or embedding images and videos in the page.</li>
        <li class="explanation"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics">CSS</a> is a language of style rules that we use to apply styling to our HTML content, for example setting background colors and fonts, and laying out our content in multiple columns.</li>
        <li class="explanation"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="explanation">The three layers build on top of one another nicely. Let's take a button as an example. We can mark it up using HTML to give it structure and purpose:</p>
      <pre class="code-block"><code>&lt;button type="button"&gt;Player 1: Chris&lt;/button&gt;</code></pre>
      <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/What_is_JavaScript/just-html.png" alt="Button showing Player 1: Chris with no styling" class="image">
      <p>Then we can add some CSS into the mix to get it looking nice:</p>
      <pre class="code-block"><code>button {
  font-family: "helvetica neue", helvetica, sans-serif;
  letter-spacing: 1px;
  text-transform: uppercase;
  border: 2px solid rgb(200 200 0 / 60%);
  background-color: rgb(0 217 217 / 60%);
  color: rgb(100 0 0 / 100%);
  box-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgb(0 0 200 / 40%);
  border-radius: 10px;
  padding: 3px 10px;
  cursor: pointer;
}
</code></pre>

<p>JavaScript can do a lot more than that — let's explore what in more detail.</p>
<section class="main-section" id="So_what_can_it_really_do?">
        <header class="definition" id="can-do">So what can it really do?</header>
        <p class="explanation">The core client-side JavaScript language consists of some common programming features that allow you to do things like:</p>
<ul>
  <li class="explanation">Store useful values inside variables. In the above example for instance, we ask for a new name to be entered then store that name in a variable called <code>name</code>.</li>
  <li class="explanation">Operations on pieces of text (known as <q>strings</q> in programming). In the above example we take the string <code>"Player 1: "</code> and join it to the <code>name</code> variable to create the complete text label, e.g., <code>"Player 1: Chris"</code>.</li>
  <li class="explanation">Running code in response to certain events occurring on a web page. We used a click event in our example above to detect when the label is clicked and then run the code that updates the text label.</li>
  <li class="explanation">And much more!</li>
</ul>

<p class="explanation">What is even more exciting however is the functionality built on top of the client-side JavaScript language. So-called Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) provide you with extra superpowers to use in your JavaScript code.</p>

<p class="explanation">APIs are ready-made sets of code building blocks that allow a developer to implement programs that would otherwise be hard or impossible to implement. They do the same thing for programming that ready-made furniture kits do for home building — it is much easier to take ready-cut panels and screw them together to make a bookshelf than it is to work out the design yourself, go and find the correct wood, cut all the panels to the right size and shape, find the correct-sized screws, and then put them together to make a bookshelf.</p>

<p class="explanation">They generally fall into two categories.</p>
<img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/What_is_JavaScript/browser.png" alt="Two categories of API; 3rd party APIs are shown to the side of the browser and browser APIs are in the browser" class="image2">
     <p class="explanation"><b>Browser API</b>s are built into your web browser, and are able to expose data from the surrounding computer environment, or do useful complex things.</p>
    <p class="explanation"><b>Third party API</b>s are not built into the browser by default, and you generally have to grab their code and information from somewhere on the Web.</p>
     <p class="explanation">There's a lot more available, too! However, don't get over excited just yet. You won't be able to build the next Facebook, Google Maps, or Instagram after studying JavaScript for 24 hours — there are a lot of basics to cover first. And that's why you're here — let's move on!</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="What_is_JavaScript_doing_on_your_page?">
        <header class="definition" id="js-on-page">What is JavaScript doing on your page?</header>
        <p class="explanation">Here we'll actually start looking at some code, and while doing so, explore what actually happens when you run some JavaScript in your page.
     <p class="explanation">Let's briefly recap the story of what happens when you load a web page in a browser (first talked about in our <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics">What is CSS</a>? article). When you load a web page in your browser, you are running your code (the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) inside an execution environment (the browser tab). This is like a factory that takes in raw materials (the code) and outputs a product (the web page).</p>
        <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/What_is_JavaScript/execution.png" alt="HTML, CSS and JavaScript code come together to create the content in the browser tab when the page is loaded" class="image2">
    <p class="explanation">A very common use of JavaScript is to dynamically modify HTML and CSS to update a user interface, via the Document Object Model API (as mentioned above).</p>
      <p class="heading">Browser security</p>
    <p class="explanation">Each browser tab has its own separate bucket for running code in (these buckets are called "execution environments" in technical terms) — this means that in most cases the code in each tab is run completely separately, and the code in one tab cannot directly affect the code in another tab — or on another website. This is a good security measure — if this were not the case, then pirates could start writing code to steal information from other websites, and other such bad things.</p>
   <p class="heading">JavaScript running order</p>
  <p class="explanation">When the browser encounters a block of JavaScript, it generally runs it in order, from top to bottom. This means that you need to be careful what order you put things in. For example, let's return to the block of JavaScript we saw in our first example:</p>
  <pre class="code-block"><code>function updateName() {
  const name = prompt("Enter a new name");
  button.textContent = `Player 1: ${name}`;
}

const button = document.querySelector("button");

button.addEventListener("click", updateName);
</code></pre>
  <p class="explanation">Here, we first define a code block called updateName() (these types of reusable code blocks are called functions), which asks the user for a new name and inserts that name into the text of a button. We then store a reference to a button using document.querySelector and attach an event listener to it using addEventListener so that when the button is clicked, the updateName() function is run.</p>
<p class="heading">Interpreted versus compiled code</p>
<p class="explanation">You might hear the terms interpreted and compiled in the context of programming. In interpreted languages, the code is run from top to bottom and the result of running the code is immediately returned. You don't have to transform the code into a different form before the browser runs it. The code is received in its programmer-friendly text form and processed directly from that.</p>
<p class="explanation">A web page with no dynamically updating content is referred to as static — it just shows the same content all the time.</p>
  </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="How_do_you_add_JavaScript_to_your_page?">
        <header class="definition" id="add-js">How do you add JavaScript to your page?</header>
<p class="explanation">
  JavaScript is applied to your HTML page in a similar manner to CSS. Whereas CSS uses 
  <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> elements to apply external stylesheets and 
  <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> elements to apply internal stylesheets to HTML, 
  JavaScript only needs one friend in the world of HTML — the 
  <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> element. Let's learn how this works.</p>
<p class="heading">Internal JavaScript</p>
<ol>
  <li class="explanation">First of all, make a local copy of our example file apply-javascript.html. Save it in a directory somewhere sensible.</li>
   <li class="explanation">Open the file in your web browser and in your text editor. You'll see that the HTML creates a simple web page containing a clickable button.</li>
    <li class="explanation">Next, go to your text editor and add the following at the bottom of your body — just before your closing <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code> tag:</li>
     <pre class="code-block"><code>&ltscript&gt
  // JavaScript goes here
&lt/script&gt
</code></pre>
    <li class="explanation">Now we'll add some JavaScript inside our <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> element to make the page do something more interesting — add the following code just below the "// JavaScript goes here" line:</li>
    <pre class="code-block"><code>function createParagraph() {
  const para = document.createElement("p");
  para.textContent = "You clicked the button!";
  document.body.appendChild(para);
}

const buttons = document.querySelectorAll("button");

for (const button of buttons) {
  button.addEventListener("click", createParagraph);
}
</code></pre>
<li class="explanation">Save your file and refresh the browser — now you should see that when you click the button, a new paragraph is generated and placed below.</li>
</ol>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Comments">
        <header class="definition" id="comments">Comments</header>
        <p class="explanation">As with HTML and CSS, it is possible to write comments into your JavaScript code that will be ignored by the browser, and exist to provide instructions to your fellow developers on how the code works (and you, if you come back to your code after six months and can't remember what you did). Comments are very useful, and you should use them often, particularly for larger applications. There are two types:</p>
     <ul>
      <li class="explanation">A single line comment is written after a double forward slash (//), e.g.</li>
      <pre class="code-block"><code>// I am a comment</code></pre>
      <li class="explanation">A multi-line comment is written between the strings /* and */, e.g.</li>
      <pre class="code-block"><code>/*
  I am also
  a comment
*/</code></pre>
     </ul>
     <p class="explanation">So for example, we could annotate our last demo's JavaScript with comments like so:</p>
     <pre class="code-block"><code>// Function: creates a new paragraph and appends it to the bottom of the HTML body.

function createParagraph() {
  const para = document.createElement("p");
  para.textContent = "You clicked the button!";
  document.body.appendChild(para);
}

/*
  1. Get references to all the buttons on the page in an array format.
  2. Loop through all the buttons and add a click event listener to each one.

  When any button is pressed, the createParagraph() function will be run.
*/

const buttons = document.querySelectorAll("button");

for (const button of buttons) {
  button.addEventListener("click", createParagraph);
}</code></pre>

      <section class="main-section" id="Summary">
        <header class="definition" id="summary">Summary</header>
        <p class="explanation">So there you go, your first step into the world of JavaScript. We've begun with just theory, to start getting you used to why you'd use JavaScript and what kind of things you can do with it. Along the way, you saw a few code examples and learned how JavaScript fits in with the rest of the code on your website, amongst other things.</p>
      <p class="explanation">JavaScript may seem a bit daunting right now, but don't worry — in this course, we will take you through it in simple steps that will make sense going forward. In the next article, we will plunge straight into the practical, getting you to jump straight in and build your own JavaScript examples.</p>
